# jLegacy
jLegacy is a fork of ESX Legacy with extra jobs support

jLegacy comes with job2 support and some extras.

You will need some dependencies but some are pre-integrated.

__***dependencies***__ (**for now**): <a href="https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql" class="button">```oxmysql```</a>

You can also get resources from my github that I will create for this.
